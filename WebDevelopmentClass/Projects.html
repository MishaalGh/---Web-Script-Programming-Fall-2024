                                In this project, I was tasked with creating a program in Python that would use many principles 
                                of object-oriented programming and cryptography. This project was very difficult not 
                                only because it forced me to adapt new strategies and approaches to my programming skills but also, 
                                because this project took me around 20+ hours to develop, and was very surprised to see a grade of 98%.

                                Throughout my years in high school, I had a small but successful computer-building business. It was at 
                                a time were PC gaming was becoming very popular and I decided to help a few friends build their own. 
                                Sooner or later word got out about my expertise and glad to say Iâ€™ve assisted 30+ clients in having 
                                their machines built and functioning. Below is an image of one of my personal best builds.
